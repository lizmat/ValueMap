NAME
====

ValueMap - Provide an immutable Map value type

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use ValueMap;

my %vm is ValueMap = foo => 42, bar => 666, baz => 137;

my $vm := ValueMap.new( (foo => 42, bar => 666, baz => 137) );

my %s is Set = $vm, %vm;
say %s.elems;  # 1
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Raku provides a semi-immutable `Associative` datatype: `Map`. A `Map` can not have any elements added or removed from it. However, since a `Map` **can** contain containers of which the value can be changed, it is **not** a value type. So you cannot use `Map`s in data structures such as `Set`s, because each `Map` is considered to be different from any other `Map`, because they are not value types.
